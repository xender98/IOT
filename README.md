Home security Project using the Raspberry pi 

  Sensor Used
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
          1)PIR sensor(for detect movement)
          
          2)LDR sensor(for measuring the intensity of light)
          
          3)PI camera

        Using PIR sensor first it detects the movement if it finds any movement then it check the light intensity 
        
        using the LDR sensor we measure the intensity of light and if light sensitivity is low 
        
        then turn on led and capture the image of intruder and 
        
        if the light intensity is high 
        
        no requirement of a turn on led we just capture the image and upload that image on dropbox so that when we are not at home 
        
        we check that image from anywhere in the word from our smartphone.
